    1. UnderStand Section:
    Before finishing this section or revealing the solution below, ensure that you have done the following:
    Established a set (2-3) of test cases to verify their own solution later.
    Established a set (1-2) of edge cases to verify their solution handles complexities.
    Have fully understood the problem and have no clarifying questions.
    Have you verified any Time/Space Constraints for this problem?
    Examples of Questions we can ask:
    Are both inputs only Strings?
    Can elements of the Strings be both characters and numbers?
    Can the second string be larger?
    Time and Space consideration -
    Best Case Time Complexity O(N*M)
    Best Case Space Complexity O(1)
        test examples:
        Input: "CATDOG", "ATDO"
        Output: True
        Input: "CATDOG", "ATDOGE"
        Output: False
        Edge Case:       //what happens if we get blank Strings, "", in this case they say return true
        Input: "CATDOG", ""
        Output: True

    2. MATCH:
    Think about matching, common patterns and tricks that could apply to this problem.
    For Strings, common solution patterns include:
        Two Pointer, left right pointer variables, or pointer on each string
        Storing the characters of the String in a hashmap or a set
        Traverse the string with a sliding window

    3. PLAN:
    Loop through the first string for an initial match. If we find one, check that
    match for a full substring match.

    1) Edge Check
    2) Loop through the first string
    3) Find a match to the first character of the second string
    4) While there is a match, loop through both strings in parallel to ensure
        the match
    5) If there is an entire match to the second string, return True (there is a
        substring)
    6) If the match breaks, continue searching the first string for an initial
        character match
    7) If we make it to the end of the first string without a full match, there
        is no substring match -- return False

    Given a number, return the next smallest prime number
